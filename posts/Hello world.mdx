title: How to write on Typed.sh
---

Typed.sh is based on markdown rendered with MDX and Chakra-UI.
You can both use markdown and React components to write post.

# Components

Followings are implemented components.

## MDAST

MDAST stands for Markdown abstract syntax tree.
You can check every available markdown syntax on following website.

> See **[syntax-tree/mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#nodes)** on GitHub

## Chakra-UI

Since MDX supports writing JSX directly into markdown,
you need to checkout available modules from Chakra-UI's documentation
if you want to make your post more beautiful.

Typed.sh is based on version 1.3.3 and all components are available without importing manually.

```jsx
<Button
  onClick={() => {
    if (confirm('Will you refresh this page?')) {
      window.location.href = ''
    }
  }}
>
  Refresh!
</Button>
```

<Button
  onClick={() => {
    if (confirm('Will you refresh this page?')) {
      window.location.href = ''
    }
  }}
>
  Refresh!
</Button>
